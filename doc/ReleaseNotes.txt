New features
============


RELAY2: allow for more than one site master
-------------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1649]

If we have a lot of traffic between sites, having more than 1 site master increases performance and reduces stress
on the single site master


Kerberos based authentication
-----------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1657]

New AUTH plugin contributed by Martin Swales. Experimental, needs more work


Probe now works with TCP too
----------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1568]

If multicasting is not enabled, probe.sh can be started as follows:
probe.sh -addr 192.168.1.5 -port 12345
, where 192.168.1.5:12345 is the physical address:port of a node.
Probe will ask that node for the addresses of all other members and then send the request to all members.



Optimizations
=============

UNICAST3: ack messages sooner
-----------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1664]

A message would get acked after delivery, not reception. This was changed, so that long running app code would not
delay acking the message, which could lead to unneeded retransmission by the sender.


Bug fixes
=========

FRAG/FRAG2: incorrect ordering with message batches
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1648]

Reassembled messages would get reinserted into the batch at the end instead of at their original position


RSVP: incorrect ordering with message batches
---------------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1641]

RSVP-tagged messages in a batch would get delivered immediately, instead of waiting for their turn


Memory leak in STABLE
---------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1638]

Occurred when send_stable_msg_to_coord_only was enabled.


NAKACK2/UNICAST3: problems with flow control
--------------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1665]

If an incoming message sent out other messages before returning, it could block forever as new credits would not be
processed. Caused by a regression (removal of ignore_sync_thread) in FlowControl.



AUTH: nodes without AUTH protocol can join cluster
--------------------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1661]

If a member didn't ship an AuthHeader, the message would get passed up instead of rejected.


LockService issues
------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1634]
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1639]
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1660]

Bug fix for concurrent tryLock() blocks and various optimizations.


Logical name cache is cleared, affecting other channels
-------------------------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1654]

If we have multiple channels in the same JVM, the a new view in one channel triggers removal of the entries
of all other caches
